## About
- It is a challenge to test my abilities to a job oportunity.
- The scope of the project is to implement a Change Machine that can inform the amount of coins to give a change.

### About the code
- The "troco" (change) functionality still don't work, I couldn't make it work in 10 days of code (And this is one of my next challenges).
- The "zerar" button does not work, it is suposed to turn all the coins quantity in data base to zero.
- The "sangria" (withdrawal) and the "abastecer" (fillCashDesk) functionalities are fully operational. I had never used Firebase until now, and I'm pretty happy to say that I could make it!
- The display functions in withdrawal and fillCashDesk activities, as well as the "conferir caixa" (viewCoins) activity need a way to spare code.  Initially I thought to pass an editText as a function argument, but I couldn't make it... In future I wish to solve this issue. I believe that study and implement more lambda functions and issues are a best way to discover it.

### Achievements
1. I made an aplication that can write and read data from firebase (from scratch and without any other knowledge in how to make it) in less than 10 days. 
2. I made a 10 day strike of code in this only project.
3. I learned more about lambda functionalities.
4. I implemented a nice UI in this app.
